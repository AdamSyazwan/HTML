  <h2>Who is Ryan Gosling</h2>

  <p>Ryan Thomas Gosling was born on November 12, 1980, at St. Joseph's Hospital in London, Ontario, the son of Thomas Ray Gosling, 
     a traveling salesman for a paper mill, and Donna, a secretary. Both of his parents are of part French Canadian descent, 
     along with some German, English, Scottish, and Irish. He and his family were members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
     Saints, and Gosling has said that the religion influenced every aspect of their lives. Because of his father's work, they 
     <em>"moved around a lot"</em> and Gosling lived in both Cornwall, Ontario and Burlington, Ontario. His parents divorced when he was 
     13, and he and his older sister Mandi lived with their mother, an experience Gosling has credited with programming him 
     <em>"to think like a girl"</em>.</p>

    <p>Gosling was educated at Gladstone Public School, Cornwall Collegiate and Vocational School and Lester B. Pearson High School.
       As a child, he watched Dick Tracy and was inspired to become an actor. He <em>"hated"</em> being a child, was bullied in elementary school,
       and had no friends until he was "14 or 15". In grade one, having been heavily influenced by the action film First Blood, he took 
       steak knives to school and threw them at other children during recess. This incident led to a suspension. He was unable to read, and
       was evaluated for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but was not diagnosed with it and, contrary to false reports, 
       never took medication. His mother left her job and home-schooled him for a year. He has said homeschooling gave him <em>"a sense of 
        autonomy that I've never really lost"</em>. Gosling performed in front of audiences from an early age, encouraged by his sister being 
       a performer. He and his sister sang together at weddings; he performed with Elvis Perry, his uncle's Elvis Presley tribute act,
        and was involved with a local ballet company. Performing boosted his self-confidence as it was the only thing for which he 
       received praise. He developed an idiosyncratic accent because, as a child, he thought having a Canadian accent did not sound 
       "tough". He began to model his accent on that of Marlon Brando. He dropped out of high school at age seventeen to focus on his 
       acting career.</p>

        <td><p>In 1993, twelve-year-old Gosling attended an open audition in Montreal for a revival of the Disney Channel's 
          The Mickey Mouse Club. He was given a two-year contract as a mouseketeer and moved to Orlando, Florida.
           He appeared on-screen infrequently because other children were considered more talented. Nonetheless, 
           he has described the job as the greatest two years of his life. Fellow cast members included Britney Spears, 
           Christina Aguilera, and Justin Timberlake. Gosling has credited the experience with instilling in them "<em>this great sense of
            focus.</em>" He became particularly close friends with Timberlake and they lived together for six months during the second 
            year of the show. Timberlake's mother became Gosling's legal guardian after his mother returned to Canada for work reasons.
             Gosling has said that even though he and Timberlake talk infrequently, they are still supportive of each other.</p>

          <td>2000–2003: Move to independent film</td>
          <td><p>In 2002, Gosling co-starred in the psychological thriller Murder by Numbers with Sandra Bullock and Michael Pitt, where 
            Gosling and Pitt portrayed a pair of high school seniors who believe they can commit the perfect murder. Bullock played the 
            detective tasked with investigating the crime. Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly described him as "<em>a phenomenal talent
              even in junk like this</em>" while Todd McCarthy felt that the "strong" and "charismatic" young actors were "<em>let down by the 
                screenplay</em>". The film was a minor commercial success, grossing $56 million worldwide from a production budget of $50 
            million. His second screen appearance of 2002 was in The Slaughter Rule with David Morse which explores the relationship 
            between a high school football player and his troubled coach in rural Montana. Gosling has said that the opportunity to work
             with Morse made him "a better actor". Stephen Holden of The New York Times described Gosling as "major star material" 
             with a "<em>rawness and an intensity that recall the young Matt Dillon</em>" while Manohla Dargis of the Los Angeles Times was 
             won over by his "raw talent". The film was released in just three US theatres and grossed $13,411.</p>

            <p>In 2003, Gosling starred in The United States of Leland as a teenager imprisoned for the murder of a disabled boy. 
              He was drawn to the role because it was unusual to find a character that was "<em>emotionally disconnected for the whole 
              film.</em>" Critic Roger Ebert felt that the "<em>gifted actor does everything that can be done with Leland, but the character comes 
              from a writer's conceits, not from life.</em>" A. O. Scott of The New York Times noted that he "<em>struggles to rescue Leland 
              from the clutches of cliché</em>" while David Rooney of Variety felt that his "<em>one-note, blankly disturbed act has none of 
              the magnetic edge of his breakthrough work in The Believer</em>". The film grossed $343,847 in the United States and was not
              released overseas.</p></td>

          <td>2010–2012: Widespread recognition</td>
          <td><p>Gosling starred in five films in 2010 and 2011. "<em>I've never had more energy,</em>" Gosling said. "<em>I'm more excited to make 
            films than I used to be. I used to kind of dread it. It was so emotional and taxing. But I've found a way to have fun while 
            doing it. And I think that translates into the films.</em>" He has also spoken of feeling depressed when not working. 
            In 2010, he starred opposite Michelle Williams in Derek Cianfrance's directorial debut, the marital drama Blue Valentine. 
            The low-budget film was mainly improvised and Gosling has said "you had to remind yourself you were making a film". 
            Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle felt he "<em>brings a preternatural understanding of people to his performance</em>"
            while A.O. Scott of The New York Times found him to be "<em>convincing as the run-down, desperate, older Dean, and maybe a bit 
            less so as the younger version</em>". Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote that he "<em>plays Dean as a snarky 
            working-class hipster, but when his anger is unleashed, the performance turns powerful.</em>" However, Wesley Morris 
            of The Boston Globe felt the performance was an example of "hipsterism misdirected". He was nominated for a Golden 
            Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama. The film was a box office success, grossing over $12 million 
            worldwide from a production budget of $1 million.[</p></td>

            <p>In early 2013, Gosling announced that he was taking a break from acting, stating, "<em>I've lost perspective on what I'm doing. 
              I think it's good for me to take a break and reassess why I'm doing it and how I'm doing it. And I think this is probably a 
              good way to learn about that.</em>" Gosling's directorial debut Lost River competed in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2014 
              Cannes Film Festival. The "fantasy noir", written by Gosling, stars Christina Hendricks, Ben Mendelsohn, and Matt Smith. 
              The film received largely unfavorable reviews. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian found it "insufferably conceited" and remarked 
              that Gosling had lost "<em>any sense of proportion or humility.</em>" Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph described Lost River as 
              "<em>any sense of proportion or humility.</em>", while Variety's Justin Chang dismissed the "derivative" film as a "train-wreck."</p>

            La La Land, for which he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and received his 
            second Academy Award for Best Actor nomination. Robbie Collin praised his chemistry with co-star Emma Stone, writing: 
            "<em>Both stars are so attuned to each other's pace and flow that their repartee just seems to tumble out, perfectly formed.</em>"
             It emerged as one of his most commercially successful films, with earnings of over $440 million against its $30 million budget.</p>
            
            <p>Also in 2017, he starred in Blade Runner 2049, a sequel to the 1982 science fiction film Blade Runner, directed by Denis 
              Villeneuve and co-starring Harrison Ford, who reprised his role as Rick Deckard. Gosling's role was as Officer K, a 
              "blade runner" working for the LAPD whose job it is to kill rogue bioengineered humans known as replicants. A. O. Scott 
              found him to be perfectly cast, adding that his "<em>ability to elicit sympathy while seeming too distracted to want it – his 
                knack for making boredom look like passion and vice versa – makes him a perfect warm-blooded robot for our time</em>".
               Despite being Gosling's largest box office opening, grossing $31.5 million domestically, the film generally underperformed
                at the box office</p>
